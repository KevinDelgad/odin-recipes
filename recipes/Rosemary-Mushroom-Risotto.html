    <h1>About the dish</h1>
    <p>Here is a super long and unneccesary life story about how this dish magically changed my life. This story has
        absoultetly nothing to do with the actual recipe itself but serves more as a way to make you annoyed as you look
        for the recipe. Now to add even more filler. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore

    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups vegetable broth (low- or no-sodium)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms caps, packed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups arborio rice</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoon mellow white miso</li>
        <li>Parmesan, shredded, to taste</li>
        <li>Sea salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 to 2 cups frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 cup fava beans, blanched and peeled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add broth to a small pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Melt butter over medium heat, then add olive oil, mushrooms, onions, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté
            for 5 minutes until onions are soft. Add garlic, rosemary, nutritional yeast and arborio rice. Stirring
            often, cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until garlic is soft and rice is toasted. Add the wine, mustard,
            and miso and mix well. Cook for a few more minutes until the wine has evaporated, stirring frequently so the
            bottom doesn't burn.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the wine is evaporated, add 1 cup of warm broth to the rice mixture. Continue to cook over medium heat,
            stirring often, until the broth is absorbed. Repeat this step, adding the broth in 1 cup increments, until
            risotto becomes thick and creamy. This should take about 20-30 minutes. If the risotto seems done, give it a
            taste and you will know. The rice should be chewy, firm, yet tender. You may not use all of the broth and
            that's ok. Don't have a meltdown.
        </li>

        <li>Increase heat to medium-high and bring soup to a strong simmer. Then reduce heat slightly to medium-low
            until the soup is simmering but not boiling. Add pasta and stir. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally,
            reducing heat if needed to keep the soup at a simmer.
        </li>

        <li>
            At this point, you can fold in whatever vegetables you are using along with the shredded vegan parm. Give it
            a taste and season with salt and pepper to your liking. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the
            asparagus is tender and the peas are bright green. Remove from heat and serve immediately.

        </li>

            To garnish, I like to fry up some additional sliced mushrooms to place on top, as well as some blanched
            vegetables (especially peas!). That's because I'm a food stylist and I want it to look extra pretty. You
            totally don't have to do this! But if you'd like to impress someone, I suggest that you do.
